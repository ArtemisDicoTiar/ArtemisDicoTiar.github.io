[**Source Code**](https://github.com/eubinecto/youtora/tree/fe_dev/fe)

## Explanation

This project's main idea is constructed by @eubinecto.

To visualise the idea, frontend page is built.

This page provides user to search a word that is mentioned in youtube script. The main goal is to show the script before and after the word is mentioned along with the youtube video player at the time the word is mentioned.

## Technology Stacks

This webpage is built after studying about REST API, FrontEnd, BackEnd and Database.

In addition, this page is built during summer internship (2020, NAVER corp) so the deployment method is enhanced then previous projects.

* Web
  * Vuejs (JavaScript)
* Deployment
  * Docker

### Web

The webpage is built with Vuejs2 along with Vuex store. 

During this project, organising method the page components and its data storage has been enhanced by following OOP.

### Deployment

During the summer internship, I have learned how to deploy the application more effectively. The Virtual machine can be an option to use but the docker is the state-of-the-art and it is easier to apply with less overhead so Docker is applied.

The docker image inlcudes both node and nginx to host the Vuejs project.

## Conclusion

Due to academic year started, this project's FrontEnd has been freezed.

Therefore, the frontend of this project is no longer updated since September-2020 even the backend and other logics are updated by @eubinecto.
